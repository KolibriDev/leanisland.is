<p>Where does lean come from and why has it spread across industries and the world? How does it change the way we manage and work together to create more value for customers while using less resources? What opportunities does lean open up for new business models in the future?</p>

<h3 id="dant2">Fyrirlestur 2: Building a Lean Management System</h3>

<p>This talk will go deeper into the three essential elements of lean management:
    <br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <span>Hoshin Planning</span>
    </li>

    <li>
        <span>Value Stream Analysis</span>
    </li>

    <li>
        <span>Standard Work and Gemba Management</span>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Bring in your questions about using these in your organization.</p>

    <p>Bjarte Bogsnes has a long international career, both in Finance and HR. He is currently heading up the Beyond Budgeting implementation at Statoil, Scandinavia's largest company with operations in 36 countries and a turnover of 130 bn USD. On Fortune 500, the company ranked #1 on Social responsibility and #7 on Innovation in 2011. &nbsp;Transparency International has named Statoil the most transparent listed company in the world.</p>

    <p>Bjarte is Chairman of Beyond Budgeting Round Table Europe (BBRT), and is a popular international business speaker. He is the author of "Implementing Beyond Budgeting - Unlocking the Performance Potential", where he writes about his implementation experiences. Statoil realized that traditional leadership and management practices no longer work in today's competence organizations operating in business environments more complex, dynamic and unpredictable than ever. The company implemented innovative alternatives to traditional management, like abolishing traditional budgets and calendar-based management in favor of more decentralized, agile and human processes.</p>

    <p>The most effective, long-lasting changes come when people make a free and informed choice to commit to trying new approaches. For many change agents the challenge is how to create conditions where this might happen. Some advice focuses on&nbsp;
        <span>creating a burning platform in order to 'hold a gun to their heads', whilst other approaches are equally manipulative but focus on easing-in approaches and asking leading questions.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <br>This talk will cover experiences changing software product development organisations, based on making processes visible, negotiating to try new approaches and creating small experiments to let people decide for themselves if they want to change. These experiences have come introducing Kanban and A/B testing to large Investment Banks and recently, at BBC Worldwide.</p>

    <h4>Bio</h4>

    <p>I work with leading software product development organisations to assist them to become more effective at achieving their business goals. I do this through helping senior leaders and teams focus on building and validating what the right products are by understanding customer demand and using iterative development approaches. I accelerate learning in organisations by helping them develop productive communication skills that allow them to make better quality decisions. I have practical real-world experience delivering software projects with exceptional results based on practical, implementable advice. I am a highly-rated international speaker on applying innovative approaches, such as Kanban, to software development.

    <p>Businesses, companies, and enterprises all around the world are facing an environment of accelerating change and increasing volatility. We are often confronted by external pressures that require us to change, adapt, or innovate in order to remain competitive. As these external pressures mount, we must solve the problems facing us more quickly and with fewer resources than in the past. In order to survive and thrive in today's dynamic world, we need new methods of managing that allow us to utilize the full potential of all our employees as they work to solve challenges they have never seen before.</p>

        <strong>Toyota Kata is a management approach</strong>that develops problem solving capability within our entire workforce. It steadily develops creativity, adaptability, and innovation through daily practice of simple but powerful routines of thought and behavior (kata). It trains managers and leaders to coach their teams in ways that enable them to solve new challenges they've never dealt with before. Toyota Kata provides the means for responding quickly and creatively to our increasing dynamic business conditions, while more fully tapping the energy and ingenuity of our greatest resource – our people. Toyota Kata is content-free and can be applied in any business environment or situation where adaptation, creativity, and innovation is called for.</p>

        <p>In the lean world one of the main things is to get everyone aligned towards common goals in order to get the best results. A strategy deployment methodology was developed in Japan to facilitate this, called Hoshin Kanri. There are a few ways to do that, some use an X-matrix while others use A3s, for instance.
            <strong>Össur Iceland have been using A3s to communicate goals throughout the manufacturing organization</strong>while Össur Americas uses the X-matrix.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>In this lecture Viktoría will go over what strategy deployment means to Össur Iceland, why they chose A3 to do it, go through their learning process on how they are making the A3s, doing catch-ball and cascading goals, and how that process has evolved and is still evolving. She will show examples of an A3 and an X-matrix, as well as comparing pros and cons.</p>

    <p>Sensing what is going on in our work can be very challenging, especially in knowledge work where we do most of our work on the computer. Coming into most office environments today you will have a hard time figuring out answers to questions like:</p>

            <li>
                <span>What work is in progress, and what people are working on it?</span>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span>Where do we have problems in the work, and what's being done about them?</span>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span>What are our goals and are we going to reach them?</span>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span>How well does the current workflow support the purpose of the work?</span>
            </li>
        </ul>

    <p>
        <span>In this talk we'll be discussing how Visual Management can help answer these and other questions. We'll start by examining the purpose of Visual Management as well as its benefits and some of the barriers to having success with it. However, most of the talk will be about practical Visual Management with lots of visual examples of how my company, Sprettur, makes use of Visual Management. Furthermore, we'll discuss how you can use Visual Management in your own workplace.</span>
